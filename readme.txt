Brief Introduction:
	This project’s purpose is to build on the knowledge gained from our previous three projects’ as well as new additional knowledge acquired from our most recent lectures. Considering that we are a new group of individuals, we have decided to create a brand-new website from scratch rather than using one of our previously existing websites. This is more challenging, but it will give each of us a better understanding of the previous material.
Purpose:
	The purpose of our website is to act like a central hub for people of all education levels to obtain information on a specific education subject. Anyone, with or without an account, may visit our website and view everything it has to offer. With no subscription fees of any kind. The user can treat this however they please, whether it be a forum about a certain topic or they need help on a homework question. It truly is up to the user’s discretion what they post on our website.
