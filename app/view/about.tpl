<h1>About</h1>

<h4 style="line-height:200%;">This project’s purpose is to build on the knowledge gained from our previous three projects’ as well as new additional knowledge acquired from our most recent lectures. Considering that we are a new group of individuals, we have decided to create a brand-new website from scratch rather than using one of our previously existing websites. This is more challenging, but it will give each of us a better understanding of the previous material.</h4>
